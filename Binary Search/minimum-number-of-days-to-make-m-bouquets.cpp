/* 
    Problem 
     - Find the minimum number of days required to make "m" bouquets, where each bouquet uses "k" adjacent flowers, given the bloom day and position of each flower in "bloomDay"

    Approaches
     1. Search from the first to last day a flower would bloom to identify the first occurrence of when "m" bouquets can be made
      a. Consider that if day x is a potential day, then y > x is not a potential day
      b. Consider that if day x is not a potential day, then y < x is not a potential day

    Data Structures
    Algorithms
     - Binary search

    Time Complexity
     - O(nâ€¢log(d)) -> n = number of flowers, d = days between latest and earliest bloom
    Space Complexity
     - O(1)
